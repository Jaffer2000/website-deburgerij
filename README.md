# Frontend Development

 During this project, I gained expertise in frontend development by working with HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. I learned how to structure web pages, style them effectively, and add interactivity using JavaScript. The project also involved building responsive websites that work seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

# CRUD Operations

As part of the project, I implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to manage user-submitted content. This allowed administrators to easily create new entries, display them dynamically on the site, update existing data through interactive forms, and delete outdated or incorrect records. I used PHP, MySQL and JavaScript to handle data manipulation and ensure a smooth user experience, while maintaining data consistency in the backend.
